# MyGFX

Simple graphics programming done in order to help me understand C, C++ and the inner working of computer graphics.
This repository contains:

## Main.cpp
Driver program to test functionality of graphics functions
Includes namespace LibTest to conduct these tests

## Screen.hpp & Screen.cpp
Screen class which represents a "screen" as an array and can convert that screen to an image

## Shape.hpp & Shape.cpp
Functions which rasterize mathematical descriptions of basic geometry
